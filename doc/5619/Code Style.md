# Code Style
---
I do not want to come out as harsh with these code styling "rules". All I ask is that we try to follow them, but if it takes a lot of time, forget about the rules. We want to have fun with coding the robot, and sometimes having a lot of rules can make it seem less enjoyable.

### Function formatting

Good:
```Java
/*
This function tells the arm to throw a cube.
*/
public void throwCube(boolean maxPower){
    /*Insert Code Here*/
}
```

Not so good:
```Java
public void coolfunctionThatdoesstuffAndthings(boolean arg1){
    /*Insert Code Here*/
}
```

### Variable Formatting

Good:
```Java
public DcMotor frontLeftMotor;
public final int MAX_MOTOR_ROTATION = 150;
```

Not so good:
```Java
public DcMotor Frontleftmotor;
public final int maxMotorRotation = 150;
```

### Class naming

Good:
```Java
public class AutonomousBlueAllience {
    /*Insert Code Here*/
}
```

Not so good:
```Java
public class ericscoolautonomous_ThatIsAMAZING {
    /*Insert Code Here*/
}
```

### Spelling
Try your hardest. No one is perfect. I am in not way a good speller what so ever. As long as you know what it means and can tell anyone if they are confused on what it means, then its fine
